        PSEUDOCODE (Documentation enhancement only — no runtime logic changes):
        - Maintain existing properties and defaults.
        - Expand class summary to clarify purpose, lifecycle, and usage.
        - For each property:
            * Add/expand <summary> for clarity.
            * Add <remarks> where useful (e.g., publishing workflow, constraints).
            * Reference related enums (StatusCodeEnum) where applicable.
            * Clarify nullability usage (e.g., Published / Expires).
            * Explain concurrency (RowVersion).
            * Document formatting/length expectations and semantic roles.
        - Avoid changing signatures or defaults to prevent migrations.
        - Keep default initializers to avoid null reference issues.

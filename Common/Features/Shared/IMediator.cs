/// <remarks>
/// This interface defines the contract for a mediator implementation that separates commands (write operations)
/// from queries (read operations) following Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) principles.
/// The mediator pattern helps decouple the sender of a request from the handler that processes it,
/// enabling better separation of concerns and testability.

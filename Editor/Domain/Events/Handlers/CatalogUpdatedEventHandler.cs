    /*
        Pseudocode (documentation update only):
        - Enhance XML summary for handler class: purpose, typical extension points.
        - Add XML doc for constructor: describe dependency.
        - Add XML doc for HandleAsync overloads:
            - Single-param overload delegates to full overload with CancellationToken.None.
            - Two-param overload logs debug message and returns completed task.
        - Clarify cancellation token usage (currently ignored).
        - No behavioral changes.

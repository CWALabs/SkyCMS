## What is an Edge-Native CMS?

**SkyCMS is an Edge-Native CMS** — a new category of content management system that combines the **editing experience of traditional CMSs** with the **performance and simplicity of static site generators**, all while being optimized for **edge delivery and global CDN distribution**.

### The Problem We Solve

Modern web teams face a difficult choice:

**Traditional CMSs** (WordPress, Drupal, etc.)

- Easy for editors to use
- Real-time content updates
- Slow performance under load
- Security vulnerabilities
- High hosting costs
- Complex scaling requirements

**Static Site Generators** (Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js)

- Blazing fast performance
- Low hosting costs
- Great security
- Complex Git-based workflows
- Requires technical knowledge
- Long build times
- Multiple tools to configure and maintain

**Headless CMSs** (Contentful, Strapi, Sanity)

- Modern editing experience
- API-driven content delivery
- Expensive API usage costs
- Requires custom frontend development
- Complex architecture with multiple systems
- Ongoing maintenance burden

### The SkyCMS Solution

**SkyCMS eliminates this false choice** by being purpose-built for edge deployment while maintaining a complete CMS editing experience:

#### **For Content Editors**

- Familiar WYSIWYG editing (CKEditor 5)
- Visual page building (GrapesJS)
- No Git knowledge required
- Instant content previews
- Built-in version control
- One-click publishing

#### **For Developers**

- No external build pipelines to configure
- No CI/CD complexity
- Direct deployment to edge locations
- Code editor with Monaco (VS Code)
- Multiple deployment modes
- Docker-based infrastructure

#### **For Performance**

- Static file generation at the edge
- Global CDN distribution
- Origin-less hosting via Cloudflare R2 + Rules (no Worker required)
- Sub-second page loads
- Handles massive traffic spikes
- Minimal infrastructure costs

### How SkyCMS Fills Its Niche

SkyCMS sits at the **intersection of three architectures**, taking the best from each:

```text
Traditional CMS          SkyCMS (Edge-Native)      Static Site Generator
(WordPress)              (Best of Both)            (Jekyll/Hugo)
     │                          │                         │
     └──────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
           Easy Editing    +    Edge Performance    =    Modern Web
```

**What Makes SkyCMS Different:**

1. **Integrated Publishing Pipeline**: Built-in Publisher component handles rendering and deployment — no external build tools, no Git workflows, no CI/CD pipelines to configure

2. **Hybrid Architecture**: Render content as static files for edge delivery while maintaining dynamic capabilities when needed

3. **Multi-Cloud Native**: Deploy to Azure, AWS, Cloudflare, or any S3-compatible storage without vendor lock-in

4. **Origin-Less Edge Hosting**: Deploy directly to Cloudflare's edge network using Cloudflare R2 + Rules (no Worker required) — no origin servers required

5. **Instant Publishing**: Changes go live in seconds, not minutes — no waiting for build pipelines

6. **Complete CMS Experience**: Full-featured content management with version control, templates, media management, and user roles — not just a "content API"

### Real-World Impact

| Scenario | Traditional CMS | Static Site Generator | SkyCMS |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|---------|
| **Content update time** | Instant (but slow delivery) | 2-15 minutes (build + deploy) | < 5 seconds |
| **Technical skill required** | Low | High (Git, CLI, build tools) | Low |
| **Performance under load** | Poor (requires scaling) | Excellent | Excellent |
| **Hosting cost (100k pageviews)** | $50-500/month | $0-10/month | $0-10/month |
| **Setup complexity** | Moderate | High (multiple tools) | Low (single platform) |
| **Maintenance burden** | High (security, updates) | High (build pipeline) | Low (containerized) |

## Overview

[SkyCMS](https://Sky-cms.com/) is an open-source, cloud-native Edge-Native CMS that **renders complete web pages** optimized for edge delivery and global distribution. Built with modern web technologies, SkyCMS runs in multiple modes to meet different deployment needs:

- **Static Mode** (Primary): Content rendered as static HTML files and hosted on cloud storage (Azure Blob, S3, Cloudflare R2) — highest performance, stability, and operational simplicity
  - Can be deployed as an **origin-less, edge-hosted** site via Cloudflare R2 + Rules (no Worker required)
  - Automatic static site generation without external build tools
  - Integrated publishing pipeline eliminates CI/CD complexity
- **Dynamic Mode**: Publisher application dynamically renders pages on-demand — full CMS functionality with server-side rendering
- **Decoupled Mode**: Separate editor and publisher applications — near-static performance with backend functionality
- **API Mode** (Optional): RESTful API available for headless scenarios — content delivered as JSON for multi-channel distribution

## Design Objectives

SkyCMS was built with the following core objectives:

- **Performance**: Outperform traditional CMSs through static site generation and optimized dynamic rendering
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to use by both web developers and non-technical content editors
- **Low Maintenance**: Easy to administer with low operational costs
- **Flexible Deployment**: Support for static, dynamic, decoupled, and optional API modes
- **Cloud-Native**: Built for modern cloud infrastructure with global scalability
- **Complete Page Rendering**: Primary focus on delivering complete HTML pages rather than API-first architecture
- **Integrated Publishing**: Built-in version control, automatic triggers, and direct cloud deployment—eliminating the complexity of traditional Git-based static site workflows

## Key Features

### Advantages Over Traditional Git-Based Static Site Deployment

SkyCMS represents a **next-generation approach** to static site publishing that eliminates the complexity and friction of traditional Git-based CI/CD workflows:

| **Traditional Approach** | **SkyCMS Approach** |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| External Git repository required | Built-in version control integrated into CMS |
| Separate CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Netlify, etc.) | Automatic triggers built into the system |
| Static site generator needed (Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby, Next.js) | Direct rendering without external build tools |
| Multiple tools to learn and configure | Single integrated platform |
| Build time delays (minutes per deployment) | Instant publishing with Publisher component |
| Complex pipeline debugging | Streamlined troubleshooting |
| Content creators need Git knowledge | User-friendly content management interface |
| Static OR dynamic content | **Hybrid: simultaneous static AND dynamic content** |
| Manual scheduling or cron-based rebuilds | **Built-in page scheduling with calendar widget** |

**Key Technical Advantages:**

- **No Build Pipeline Required**: Content is rendered directly by the Publisher component, eliminating wait times and pipeline configuration
- **Integrated Version Control**: Full versioning system built into the CMS—no external Git workflow needed
- **Automatic Deployment**: Direct deployment to Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3, or Cloudflare R2 without intermediary services
- **Built-in Page Scheduling**: Schedule pages for future publication with a simple calendar widget—no GitHub Actions, cron jobs, or CI/CD scheduling needed
- **Faster Publishing**: Changes go live immediately without waiting for CI/CD builds
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Serve static files for performance while maintaining dynamic capabilities when needed
- **Simplified Operations**: Fewer moving parts mean less infrastructure to maintain and fewer points of failure
- **Multi-Cloud Native**: Deploy to any cloud platform that supports Docker containers and object storage

### Performance Benchmarks

Real-world comparison of publishing workflows:

| Scenario | Git-Based (Netlify) | SkyCMS |
|----------|-------------------|---------|
| Single page update | 2-5 minutes | < 5 seconds |
| Bulk content update (50 pages) | 5-15 minutes | < 30 seconds |
| Image optimization | Build-time penalty | On-upload processing |
| Preview environment | Separate branch + build | Instant preview mode |
| Rollback time | Redeploy previous build (2-5 min) | Instant version restore |
| **Scheduled publishing** | **Cron job + full rebuild** | **Calendar widget + instant activation** |

This **CMS-native approach** achieves the same benefits as JAMstack (speed, scalability, global distribution) but with dramatically reduced complexity and operational overhead.

### Content Management

- **Multiple Content Types**: Standard pages, blog posts, and custom article types
- **Rich Editing Tools**: CKEditor 5, GrapesJS, Monaco Editor, and Filerobot image editor
- **Version Control**: Full versioning system with restore capabilities
- **Template System**: Reusable page templates with editable regions
- **Page Scheduling**: Schedule pages for automatic publication at future dates and times using Hangfire
- **Multi-Mode Publishing**: Static file generation, dynamic rendering, or optional API delivery

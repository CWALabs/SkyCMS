# SkyCMS Developer Documentation

Welcome to the developer documentation area. This section complements the feature guides under `Docs/` by describing the architecture, shared components, and extension points used across SkyCMS projects.

## Sections

- **Controllers**
  - [HomeControllerBase](Controllers/HomeControllerBase.md): Shared base controller used by Publisher and Editor.

- **Editor Widgets**
  - [Image Widget](ImageWidget.md): Per‑widget attributes (including `data-ccms-enable-alt-editor`) and developer hooks.

> Tip: If you introduce new shared services or base classes, add corresponding docs here to keep the codebase discoverable.

# Documentation Contribution Guide

Welcome to the SkyCMS documentation. This guide outlines how documentation is organized, maintained, and improved.

- [Documentation Ownership Model](#documentation-ownership-model)
- [File Naming Conventions](#file-naming-conventions)
- [File Header Template](#file-header-template)
- [Update Triggers](#update-triggers)
- [Review Schedule](#review-schedule)
- [Best Practices](#best-practices)

---

## Before You Start

All documentation is in the `/Docs/` folder. The main entry points are:

- **[README.md](./README.md)** - Primary documentation hub (start here)
- **[LEARNING_PATHS.md](./LEARNING_PATHS.md)** - Role-based documentation journeys
- **[About.md](./About.md)** - SkyCMS overview and positioning

### Overview vs Reference Pattern

- **Overviews** answer what/why/when and point to related guides.
- **Configuration references** hold the authoritative settings, defaults, and examples (one per area, e.g., Database-Configuration-Reference.md).
- **Provider/setup guides** live alongside overviews and should link to the reference and overview.
- Start new docs from the templates in [_templates](./_templates/) to keep structure consistent.

---

## Documentation Ownership Model

Each documentation file should have clear ownership and maintenance responsibility.

### File Header Template

Add this header to the top of major documentation files:

```markdown
---
Owner: @github-username
Last Reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
Status: Current | Needs Update | Deprecated
Related Docs: [Link to related docs]
---
```

### Example

```markdown
---
Owner: @toiyabe
Last Reviewed: 2025-12-15
Status: Current
Related Docs: [Database-CosmosDB.md](./Configuration/Database-CosmosDB.md), [Database Config Reference](./Configuration/Database-Configuration-Reference.md)
---

# Azure Cosmos DB Configuration
```

### Status Values

- **Current** - Documentation is accurate and complete for the latest release
- **Needs Update** - Documentation exists but may be incomplete or outdated
- **Deprecated** - Documentation covers deprecated features; marked for removal
- **In Progress** - Documentation is being written/updated

### Owner Responsibilities

The owner is responsible for:

1. **Accuracy** - Keeping information correct and up-to-date
2. **Completeness** - Ensuring all relevant information is documented
3. **Currency** - Reviewing and updating as features change
4. **Clarity** - Maintaining consistent quality and readability
5. **Links** - Keeping cross-references accurate and useful

---

## File Naming Conventions

Maintain consistency in naming for easy discovery and organization.

### Standard Pattern

Use **PascalCase with hyphens** for multi-word concepts:

```
✅ CORRECT:
Database-Overview.md
Database-Configuration-Reference.md
Live-Editor-Quick-Start.md
Azure-Installation-Guide.md
Cost-Comparison.md

❌ INCORRECT:
DatabaseOverview.md
database_overview.md
databaseoverview.md
Database Overview.md
QuickStart.md (use hyphens for clarity)
```

### File Organization

```

## Style Guide

### Tone

- **Professional but friendly**
- Not too formal, not too casual
- Clear and direct
- Encouraging and helpful
- Assume reader wants to succeed

### Voice

- **Active voice** (preferred)
  - ✅ "Click the Save button"
  - ❌ "The Save button should be clicked"

- **Second person** (when giving instructions)
  - ✅ "You can configure..."
  - ✅ "To configure..."
  - ❌ "Users can configure..." (usually)

### Capitalization

- Capitalize UI element names: "Click the Save Button"
- Don't capitalize common words: "the page template"
- Capitalize proper nouns: "Azure Cosmos DB"

### Code

```markdown
- Inline code: `variable-name`, `appsettings.json`
- Code blocks: Use markdown fences with language
- Comments: Explain non-obvious code
```

### Links

```markdown
- Descriptive text: [Database Configuration Guide](./Database-Overview.md)
- Relative paths: Use `./` for same folder, `../` for parent
- Avoid: [Click here](link), [Link](link)
```

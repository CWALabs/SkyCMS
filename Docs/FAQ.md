## General Questions

### What is SkyCMS?

SkyCMS is an **Edge-Native CMS** — a modern alternative to traditional CMSs, static site generators, and headless CMSs. It combines the **ease-of-use of WordPress** with the **performance of static sites** and **flexibility of modern architectures**.

Key features:
- WYSIWYG editor (CKEditor 5) + visual page builder (GrapesJS)
- Static file generation with instant publishing (< 5 seconds)
- Multi-cloud deployment (AWS, Azure, Cloudflare)
- Built-in team workflows (draft → review → publish)
- No Git knowledge required for content creators

### Is SkyCMS open source?

Yes. SkyCMS is licensed under **GPL v2.0** — free to use, modify, and distribute.

### Who should use SkyCMS?

**Best for:**
- Small to medium sites (1-1000 pages)
- Teams mixing developers and non-technical content creators
- Projects requiring fast, predictable performance
- Multi-tenant SaaS or agency scenarios
- Sites needing low operational overhead

**Less ideal for:**
- Very large monolithic platforms (100k+ pages)

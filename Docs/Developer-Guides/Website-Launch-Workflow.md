## Overview

Launching a new website with SkyCMS involves more than just installing the software. You need to:

1. **Understand the architecture** - How Layouts, Templates, and Pages work together
2. **Plan the site structure** - Determine page types and content organization
3. **Build reusable foundations** - Create layouts and templates for consistency
4. **Populate initial content** - Create your first pages and set up navigation
5. **Prepare for handoff** - Document workflows and train content creators
6. **Support creators** - Ensure smooth transition to non-technical team

This workflow is **iterative** - you may loop back to earlier phases as you discover new requirements or content types.

## Who This Is For

**Primary Audience:**
- Full-stack developers building custom SkyCMS sites
- Frontend developers responsible for site design
- Development leads overseeing SkyCMS projects

**Supporting Audience:**
- Project managers coordinating the launch
- Content strategists planning page types
- Technical leads making architecture decisions

**NOT for:**
- Content creators (see [Content Creator Training Guide](../Getting-Started-Content-Creators/Training-Document-Template.md) instead)
- End-users managing the site post-launch
- System administrators managing SkyCMS infrastructure

## Prerequisites

Before starting this workflow, you should have:

- ✅ SkyCMS running and initialized (follow [Setup Wizard](../Installation/SetupWizard.md) first)

## Architecture Foundation

Before you start building, understand how SkyCMS pieces fit together:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    LAYOUT                           │
│  (Site-wide structure: header, nav, footer)        │
│                                                     │
│  ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐  │
│  │                                              │  │
│  │              TEMPLATE CONTENT AREA           │  │
│  │  (Defines page structure: hero, sidebar...) │  │
│  │                                              │  │
│  │  ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐   │  │
│  │  │                                      │   │  │
│  │  │     PAGE CONTENT                    │   │  │
│  │  │  (Actual content: text, images...)  │   │  │
│  │  │                                      │   │  │
│  │  └──────────────────────────────────────┘   │  │
│  │                                              │  │
│  └──────────────────────────────────────────────┘  │
│                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Key Relationships**

| Component | Purpose | Scope | Who Changes It |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Layout** | Site-wide structure (header, footer, nav) | Entire site | Developer (rarely) |
| **Template** | Page type structure (e.g., blog post layout) | All pages using this template | Developer (occasionally) |
| **Page** | Actual content instance | Single page | Content creator (frequently) |

### **Real-World Example**

```
LAYOUT: "Main Layout"
├── Header (site logo, main nav) - shared by all pages
├── Footer (contact info, links) - shared by all pages
└── Main Content Area
    └── TEMPLATE: "Blog Post Template"
        ├── Title area
        ├── Author/date area
        ├── Featured image area
        └── Content area
            └── PAGE: "Why We Love SkyCMS"
                ├── Title: "Why We Love SkyCMS"
                ├── Author: "Jane Smith"
                ├── Date: "Dec 17, 2025"
                ├── Image: (blog-hero.jpg)
                └── Content: (the full blog post text)

            └── PAGE: "Getting Started with SkyCMS"
                ├── Title: "Getting Started with SkyCMS"
                ├── Author: "Bob Johnson"
                └── ... (different content, same template)
```

**Notice:** Both blog posts use the same Template and Layout, but have different content. Change the template → affects both blogs. Change a page → only affects that page.

## Workflow Timeline

### **Typical Project Timeline**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ TOTAL PROJECT TIME: ~35-55 hours (varies by site complexity) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Week 1:
  Phase 1: Design & Planning .......... 4-5 hours (Mon-Tue)
  Phase 2: Creating Layouts ........... 6-8 hours (Tue-Wed)
  Phase 3: Creating Templates ......... 10-16 hours (Wed-Fri)

Week 2:
  Phase 4: Building Home Page ......... 4-6 hours (Mon-Tue)
  Phase 5: Building Initial Pages .... 8-12 hours (Tue-Fri)

Week 3:
  Phase 6: Preparing for Handoff ....... 4-8 hours (Mon-Wed)
  Pre-Launch Checklist & QA ........... 4-8 hours (Wed-Fri)
  Launch & Handoff ................... (Friday)
```

**Actual timeline depends on:**
- Site complexity (number of page types)
- Team availability
- Design complexity
- Content readiness
- Number of pages in launch set

## Decision Trees

### **Decision: Should This Be a New Template or Page Variation?**

```
"I need a different layout for this page type"
         |
         v
   Is this layout used by:
   • More than one page? → Create new TEMPLATE
   • Only this one page? → Create on this PAGE as custom
```

### **Decision: Should This Be a Layout Change or Template Change?**

```
"The header needs updating"
         |
         v
   Does it affect:
   • All pages on the site? → Change the LAYOUT
   • Just pages of one type? → Change the TEMPLATE
   • Just this one page? → Customize this PAGE
```

### **Decision: When to Add a New Template?**

```
"Do we need a template for this content type?"
         |
         v
   Will we create:
   • Multiple pages of this type? → YES, create template
   • Just one page? → NO, customize a page
         |
         v
   Is it significantly different from existing templates?
   • Very different structure? → Create NEW template
   • Similar to existing? → Use/modify existing template
```

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ **Pitfall 1: Mixing Content and Structure**

**Problem:** Creating a "Contact Page" layout instead of a reusable template
```
Bad: Layout named "Contact Layout"
     └─ Specific to contact page, not reusable

Good: Template named "Contact Form Template"
      └─ Can be used for multiple contact-type pages
```

**Solution:** Separate concerns. Layouts are for site structure. Templates are for page types.

### ❌ **Pitfall 2: Over-Engineering from the Start**

**Problem:** Building 20 templates before creating any pages
```
Waste of time on templates you might not need
```

**Solution:** Build the minimum templates for launch, add more as needed.

### ❌ **Pitfall 3: Not Testing with Content Creators**

**Problem:** Building templates that are confusing or hard to use
```
"Why is this field hidden?"
"How do I add a section?"
"What's a 'featured image'?"
```

**Solution:** Have content creators test templates during Phase 5-6 and adjust based on feedback.

### ❌ **Pitfall 4: Forgetting Navigation Setup**

**Problem:** Building pages but no navigation structure
```
Readers can't find pages
Internal linking missing
SEO suffers
```

**Solution:** Plan navigation structure in Phase 1, implement in Phase 5.

### ❌ **Pitfall 5: Launching with Incomplete Pages**

**Problem:** Publishing pages with placeholder content or broken links
```
Unprofessional appearance
Broken links hurt SEO
Confuses visitors
```

**Solution:** Use pre-launch checklist to verify all pages before publishing.

### ❌ **Pitfall 6: No Documentation for Content Creators**

**Problem:** Handing off to content creators with no guides
```
"How do I create a blog post?"
"What's a template?"
"Where's my publish button?"
Constant support requests
```

**Solution:** Create training guide and style guide in Phase 6 before handoff.

## 1. Planning Your Page Structure

Before creating pages, plan their organization and hierarchy.

### Understanding Page Hierarchy

Page hierarchy determines URL structure and site organization.

#### URL Structure Basics

```
yoursite.com/               ← Home page (root)
yoursite.com/about          ← Top-level page
yoursite.com/services       ← Top-level page
yoursite.com/services/web-design    ← Second-level page (child of /services)
yoursite.com/contact        ← Top-level page
```

**Hierarchy Principles:**

- **Top-level pages**: Directly under root (e.g., `/about`, `/services`)
- **Second-level pages**: Children of top-level (e.g., `/services/web-design`)
- **Third-level pages**: Children of second-level (e.g., `/services/web-design/ecommerce`)

**Best Practices:**

✅ **Keep it shallow**: 2-3 levels maximum (easier navigation, better SEO)  
✅ **Logical grouping**: Related pages under same parent  
✅ **Clear URLs**: Descriptive, lowercase, hyphenated  
✅ **Consistent structure**: Similar page types use similar URLs  

❌ **Avoid:**
- Deep nesting (4+ levels)
- Confusing URLs (`/page1`, `/temp`, `/new-page-copy`)
- Special characters in URLs
- Constantly changing URL structure

#### Common Website Structures

```

## 3. Creating Service or Product Pages

Service/product pages explain what you offer and convert visitors into customers.

### Planning Your Service/Product Pages

#### Single vs. Multiple Service Pages

**Option 1: Single Services Page** (`/services`)
- **Best for**: 3-5 services, similar offerings
- **Structure**: All services on one page with sections
- **Pros**: Simple, less maintenance
- **Cons**: Can get long, harder to rank for specific services

**Option 2: Services Parent + Child Pages**
- **Best for**: Multiple distinct services, SEO focus
- **Structure**: 
  ```
  /services (overview page)
  /services/web-design
  /services/seo
  /services/marketing
  ```
- **Pros**: Better SEO, detailed service info, focused CTAs
- **Cons**: More pages to maintain

**Option 3: No Parent Page, Individual Pages**

  ```
  /web-design
  /seo
  /marketing
  ```
- **Pros**: Strongest SEO, clearest focus
- **Cons**: Navigation may be unclear

#### Which Structure to Choose?

| Scenario | Recommended Structure |
|----------|-----------------------|
| **Freelancer** with 3 services | Single page (/services) |
| **Agency** with 5+ distinct services | Parent + child pages |
| **SaaS** with multiple products | Individual pages (no parent) |
| **E-commerce** with product categories | Parent + child pages |

## 5. Setting Up Navigation

Ensure all your new pages are accessible through navigation.

### Understanding SkyCMS Navigation

Navigation in SkyCMS is typically controlled through:

1. **Layout File**: Navigation structure defined in your site design
2. **Menu Management**: Some SkyCMS setups have menu management UI
3. **Manual Links**: Hardcoded links in layout/template

> **Check with your administrator** about how navigation is managed in your specific SkyCMS setup.

### Verifying Navigation Links

Your navigation should include all essential pages.

#### Typical Header Navigation

```
Logo | Home | About | Services | Portfolio | Contact
```

Or with dropdown:

```
Logo | Home | About | Services ▼ | Portfolio | Contact
                      ├─ Web Design
                      ├─ SEO
                      └─ Marketing
```

#### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Home link present (usually the logo)
- [ ] About page linked
- [ ] Services/Products page(s) linked
- [ ] Contact page linked

## 6. Internal Linking Strategy

Internal links connect your pages and improve SEO.

### Why Internal Linking Matters

**Benefits:**
- **SEO**: Helps search engines discover and understand pages
- **User Experience**: Helps visitors find related content
- **Page Authority**: Distributes ranking power across site
- **Engagement**: Increases time on site, pages per visit

### Where to Add Internal Links

**1. Navigation** (Primary)
- Header menu
- Footer menu
- Breadcrumbs

**2. Content Links** (Contextual)
- In body text where relevant
- "Learn more about [topic]" with link
- Related services/products mentions

**3. Call-to-Action Links**
- End of sections
- Sidebar widgets
- Related content boxes

### Internal Linking Best Practices

**Anchor Text (Link Text):**

✅ **Good anchor text:**
- Descriptive: "our web design services"
- Specific: "schedule a free consultation"
- Natural: "learn more about SEO"

❌ **Poor anchor text:**
- "Click here"
- "Read more"
- "This page"

**Linking Strategy:**

1. **Home page** should link to all top-level pages
2. **About page** should link to services and contact
3. **Service pages** should link to:
   - Other related services
   - Portfolio/case studies
   - Contact page (CTA)
4. **Contact page** needs no outbound internal links (it's the destination)

**Example - Adding Links to About Page:**

```markdown
We specialize in [web design](/services/web-design), 
[SEO](/services/seo), and [digital marketing](/services/marketing). 
Our team has helped over 150 businesses grow their online presence.

   - Select text you want to make a link
   - Click **Link** icon in toolbar
   - Enter URL (starting with `/` for internal)
     - Example: `/about`, `/services/web-design`, `/contact`
   - Click **OK** or **Insert**

2. **Verify the link:**
   - Click the link in preview mode
   - Ensure it goes to correct page

## Need Help?

**Common Questions:**

**Q: How many pages should I create in Phase 5?**  
A: Focus on essential pages: Home, About, Services/Products, Contact. Additional pages (blog, FAQ, etc.) can come later.

**Q: Should I create all service pages at once?**  
A: Start with your most important services. You can add more pages later as needed.

**Q: What if I don't have all content ready?**  
A: Create pages with placeholder content and mark as Draft. Publish when content is complete.

**Q: How do I know if my navigation is correct?**  
A: Test user journey: Can you get from home to every page in 1-2 clicks? If yes, it's good.

**Q: Can I change page URLs after publishing?**  
A: Possible but not recommended (breaks links, SEO impact). Choose URLs carefully.

**Q: How long should each page be?**  
A: About: 400-800 words. Services: 500-1000 words. Contact: 150-300 words. Quality over quantity.

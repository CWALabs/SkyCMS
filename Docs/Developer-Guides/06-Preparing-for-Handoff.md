```

**Key Principles:**

- **Least Privilege**: Give users only the access they need

- **Clear Ownership**: Each person has defined responsibilities
- **Audit Trail**: SkyCMS tracks who made what changes

### Creating User Accounts

**Email Notification:**
- [ ] Notify user of account creation

**Department/Team (Optional):**

- Example: "Marketing", "Content", "Development"

#### Step 5: Save and Notify

1. Click **Create** or **Save**

## 5. Establishing Content Workflows

Clear workflows prevent mistakes and ensure consistency.

### Workflow Roles

Before publishing, decide who does what:

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Creator** | Writes content, creates pages |
| **Reviewer** | Checks for quality, brand compliance |
| **Approver** | Makes final decision to publish |
| **Publisher** | Moves content live |

**Typical Small Team Workflow:**

```
Content Creator writes draft
    ↓
Approver reviews
    ↓
Creator or Approver publishes
```

**Typical Large Team Workflow:**

```
Creator drafts
    ↓
Reviewer checks quality/brand
    ↓
Approver signs off
    ↓
Publisher makes live
```

### Setting Up Workflows in SkyCMS

#### Using Draft/Published States

**Process:**
1. Creator creates page in Draft state
2. Reviewer provides feedback (comments or direct edit)
3. Creator revises (saves as Draft)
4. Approver reviews again
5. Once approved, Publisher clicks Publish

**Using Version History:**
- SkyCMS tracks all versions
- Easy to see who changed what
- Can revert if needed

#### Using Naming Conventions

Help identify status with URL patterns:

```
/draft-new-blog-post       ← In progress
/blog/new-blog-post        ← Published

/draft-service-page        ← Under review
/services/new-service      ← Live
```

Or use page naming:

```
[DRAFT] Q1 Results Post
[REVIEW] New Product Announcement
Products > New Feature
```

### Approval Gates

Define what needs approval before publishing:

**Always Need Approval:**
- Homepage content
- Service/product pages
- Legal/compliance pages
- Public communications

**May Not Need Approval:**
- Blog posts (if creator is trusted)
- Internal pages
- Updates to existing content (minor)

**Never Need Approval:**
- Draft pages (not live yet)
- Password-protected pages
- Internal-only pages

### Timeline and Frequency

Establish publishing schedule:

**Content Calendar:**
- Plan content monthly
- Assign deadlines
- Coordinate across team

**Example Schedule:**

```
Monday:     Planning meeting, assign content
Tuesday:    Content creators draft pages
Wednesday:  Review and feedback
Thursday:   Revisions completed
Friday:     Approval and publishing
```

**Frequency Guidelines:**

| Content Type | Frequency |
|--------------|-----------|
| Blog Posts | 1-2 per week |
| News/Updates | As needed |
| Service Pages | Monthly review |
| Product Pages | Monthly review |
| Homepage | Every 2 weeks |

---

### Support Structure

#### Level 3: Administrator Support

**Resources for complex issues:**

- Technical troubleshooting
- User management
- System configuration

**When to escalate:**
- Issue not resolved by Level 1-2

### Support Ticket System

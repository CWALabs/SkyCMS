# CDN Integration Overview

SkyCMS can purge CDN caches after publish so fresh content appears immediately. Supported providers:

- Azure Front Door
- Cloudflare CDN
- Amazon CloudFront
- Sucuri CDN/WAF

## When to use this
- You publish via SkyCMS and need CDN cache purges to make changes visible immediately.
- You must choose or configure a CDN provider (Front Door, Cloudflare, CloudFront, Sucuri).

## Why this matters
- Without cache purging, visitors may see stale content after publish.
- Correct scoping of credentials reduces risk while enabling automated invalidations.

## Key takeaways
- Configure CDN settings in Editor → Settings → CDN; use least-privilege tokens/roles.
- Purge failures don’t block publish; they only affect cache freshness.
- Each provider requires specific IDs/tokens; validate with the test button before go-live.

## Prerequisites
- Active CDN distribution/zone and credentials with purge/invalidation rights only.
- Target URLs/paths you plan to purge and awareness of propagation delays.

## Quick path
1. Select provider and gather required IDs/tokens (see table below).
2. Enter credentials in Settings → CDN and run **Save and test settings**.
3. Publish content and confirm cache invalidation completes; monitor CDN logs if available.

## How CDN integration works

- You provide provider-specific credentials/IDs in **Editor → Settings → CDN**.
- SkyCMS issues targeted cache invalidations (paths) after publishes.
- Each provider requires narrowly scoped credentials (least privilege) to create/read invalidations or purge cache.

## Quick prerequisites by provider

| Provider | Values you need | Permission scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Azure Front Door | Subscription ID, Resource Group, Front Door Profile Name, Endpoint Name | Azure role with rights to purge endpoint cache (e.g., CDN Endpoint Contributor on the profile) |
| Cloudflare | Zone ID, API Token with Zone.Cache Purge | API Token scoped to the zone, permission: **Zone.Cache Purge** |
| CloudFront | Distribution ID, IAM Access Key/Secret, AWS Region (use `us-east-1`) | IAM policy allowing `cloudfront:CreateInvalidation` + `cloudfront:GetInvalidation` on the distribution ARN |
| Sucuri | API Key, API Secret | Dashboard API key/secret for the protected site |

## Configure in SkyCMS (common steps)

1. In the Editor, open **Settings → CDN**.
2. Fill in the fields for your provider (see per-provider guides below).
3. Click **Save and test settings**. Fix any permission or ID errors before going live.

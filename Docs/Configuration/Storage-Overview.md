# Storage Configuration Overview

SkyCMS stores static web assets (images, CSS/JS, downloads) in cloud object storage. Supported providers:

- Azure Blob Storage
- Amazon S3
- Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible)
- Google Cloud Storage (S3-compatible)
- Any S3-compatible storage

## When to use this
- You need to select and configure a storage provider for SkyCMS assets.
- You plan to switch providers (Azure Blob, S3, R2, GCS) and want connection formats fast.

## Why this matters
- Correct storage setup determines where published assets live and how fast they’re delivered.
- Misconfigured credentials or endpoints block publishing and media uploads.

## Key takeaways
- Use `StorageConnectionString` to drive provider selection; wizard for first-time, env vars for production.
- Keep storage region close to your users/CDN; use least-privilege keys.
- Any S3-compatible endpoint works if connection string matches format.

## Prerequisites
- Chosen provider, bucket/container, and credentials with create/write/list permissions.
- Public endpoint/CDN URL for the bucket if serving static assets.
- For wizard use: `CosmosAllowSetup=true` set before launch.

## Quick path
1. Pick provider; gather connection string and public endpoint.
2. Configure via wizard (single-tenant) or env vars/appsettings (production/CI).
3. Test upload/publish and confirm files appear in the bucket/container.

## How storage configuration works

- You provide a **connection string** that identifies the storage provider and credentials.
- SkyCMS automatically selects the correct storage driver based on the connection string format.
- Connection strings are configured via:
  - **SkyCMS Setup Wizard** (easiest for first-time setup)
  - **appsettings.json** (manual configuration)
  - **Environment variables** (recommended for secrets)

The configuration key is: `ConnectionStrings:StorageConnectionString`

## Quick prerequisites by provider

| Provider | Connection String Format | Where to get values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Azure Blob Storage** | `DefaultEndpointsProtocol=...;AccountName=...;AccountKey=...` | Azure Portal → Storage account → Access keys |
| **Amazon S3** | `Bucket=...;Region=...;KeyId=...;Key=...` | AWS Console → IAM → Access keys, S3 bucket info |
| **Cloudflare R2** | `AccountId=...;Bucket=...;KeyId=...;Key=...` | Cloudflare Dashboard → R2 → S3 API Tokens |
| **Google Cloud Storage** | `Bucket=...;Region=...;AccessKey=...;SecretKey=...;ServiceUrl=https://storage.googleapis.com` | Google Cloud Console → Cloud Storage → Interoperability |

## Configure in SkyCMS (common steps)

### Option 1: Setup Wizard (recommended for first-time setup)

1. Deploy SkyCMS with `CosmosAllowSetup=true`.
2. Open the Editor setup wizard.
3. When prompted for **Storage**, paste your connection string and public URL.
4. The wizard validates connectivity and creates containers/buckets.

### Option 2: Manual Configuration (appsettings.json)

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "StorageConnectionString": "your-connection-string-here"
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Environment Variables

Set before starting SkyCMS:
```powershell
$env:ConnectionStrings__StorageConnectionString = "your-connection-string"
```

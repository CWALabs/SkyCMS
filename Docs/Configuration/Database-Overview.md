# Database Configuration Overview

SkyCMS stores CMS data (users, content, settings) in a relational or document database. Supported providers:

- Azure Cosmos DB (NoSQL/document)
- MS SQL Server / Azure SQL (relational)
- MySQL (relational)
- SQLite (file-based; development/testing only)

## When to use this
- You need to choose a database provider for SkyCMS and get the right connection string format.
- You want a fast path to configure or switch providers (Cosmos DB, SQL Server, MySQL, SQLite).

## Why this matters
- Correct provider/connection setup is foundational; mistakes block the app from starting.
- Picking the right provider affects latency, cost, and scaling strategy.

## Key takeaways
- Use the wizard for first-time single-tenant setup; use env vars for production/automation.
- SQLite is for dev/test only; use managed SQL/MySQL/Cosmos for shared or production.
- ConnectionStrings: `ApplicationDbContextConnection` drives provider selection automatically.

## Prerequisites
- Chosen provider and a reachable database instance.
- Credentials/connection string with create/read/write permissions for the app.
- For wizard use: `CosmosAllowSetup=true` set before launch.

## Quick path
1. Pick a provider and assemble its connection string (see table below).
2. Configure via wizard (single-tenant) or env vars/appsettings (production/CI).
3. Start the app and verify connectivity; check logs for provider/EF provider load.

## How database configuration works

- You provide a **connection string** that identifies the database provider and credentials.
- SkyCMS automatically selects the correct Entity Framework Core provider based on the connection string format.
- Connection strings are configured via:
  - **SkyCMS Setup Wizard** (easiest for first-time setup)
  - **appsettings.json** (manual configuration)
  - **Environment variables** (recommended for secrets)

The configuration key is: `ConnectionStrings:ApplicationDbContextConnection`

## Quick prerequisites by provider

| Provider | Connection String Format | Where to get values |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Azure Cosmos DB** | `AccountEndpoint=...;AccountKey=...;Database=...` | Azure Portal → Cosmos DB → Keys & Connection Strings |
| **MS SQL / Azure SQL** | `Server=...;Database=...;User ID=...;Password=...` | SQL Server Management Studio or Azure Portal → SQL Database → Connection strings |
| **MySQL** | `Server=...;Uid=...;Pwd=...;Database=...` | MySQL admin console or cloud provider dashboard |
| **SQLite** | `Data Source=skycms.db` | File-based; generated automatically |

## Configure in SkyCMS (common steps)

### Option 1: Setup Wizard (recommended for first-time setup)

1. Deploy SkyCMS with `CosmosAllowSetup=true`.
2. Open the Editor setup wizard.
3. When prompted for **Database**, paste your connection string.
4. The wizard validates connectivity and creates tables.

### Option 2: Manual Configuration (appsettings.json)

```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "ApplicationDbContextConnection": "your-connection-string-here"
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Environment Variables

Set before starting SkyCMS:
```powershell
$env:ConnectionStrings__ApplicationDbContextConnection = "your-connection-string"
```

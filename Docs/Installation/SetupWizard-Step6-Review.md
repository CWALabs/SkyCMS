## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to create administrator account"

**Possible causes**:
- Database connection lost
- Password doesn't meet requirements (should have been validated earlier)
- Username/email already exists (rare in fresh install)

**Solution**: 
1. Check database connectivity
2. Verify admin credentials format
3. Review error message for specifics
4. Click "Back" to re-enter credentials

### "Failed to save configuration"

**Possible causes**:
- Database write permissions
- Storage connection invalid
- Configuration conflict

**Solution**:
1. Verify database is writable
2. Check all connections are valid
3. Review error details
4. Click "Back" to verify settings

### "Setup lock failed to apply"

**Issue**: Setup completed but wizard is still accessible.

**Solution**: 
1. Manually set `CosmosAllowSetup=false` in database or environment variables
2. Restart application
3. If persistent, check logs for errors

### Application Doesn't Restart After Setup

**Cause**: Some environments require manual restart.

**Solution**:

**Docker**:
```powershell
docker-compose restart
```

**Kubernetes**:
```powershell
kubectl rollout restart deployment/skycms-editor
kubectl rollout restart deployment/skycms-publisher
```

**Manual/Development**:
- Stop the application (Ctrl+C)
- Restart using `dotnet run` or your IDE

### Cannot Access Admin Panel After Setup

**Possible causes**:
- Admin credentials incorrect
- Cookie/session issues
- Browser cache

**Solution**:
1. Verify you're using credentials entered in Step 2
2. Clear browser cookies for the site
3. Try incognito/private browsing
4. Check application logs for authentication errors

## Configuration Changes After Setup

After setup is complete, configuration changes must be made via:

### Environment Variables

Modify environment variables and restart:

```powershell
$env:CosmosPublisherUrl = "https://new-url.com"
# Restart application
```

### Database Configuration

Some settings are stored in the database and can be modified via:
- Admin panel → Settings
- Direct database updates (advanced)

### Re-Running Setup Wizard

To re-run the setup wizard (⚠️ **Caution**):

1. Set `CosmosAllowSetup=true` in environment or database
2. Restart application
3. Navigate to `/___setup`

**Warning**: Re-running setup on a production system can overwrite existing configuration. Only do this if needed.

## What Happens Next

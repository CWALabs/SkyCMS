## Password Strength Indicator

The wizard displays a real-time password strength indicator as you type:

- 🔴 **Weak** - Does not meet requirements
- 🟡 **Fair** - Meets minimum requirements
- 🟢 **Strong** - Exceeds minimum requirements

**Aim for "Strong"** by using:
- Mix of upper and lowercase
- Multiple numbers and special characters
- Length of 12+ characters

---

## Security Best Practices

### Choose a Strong Password

✅ **DO**:
- Use a password manager to generate and store the password
- Use 12+ characters
- Use a unique password (not reused from other sites)
- Include mix of character types

❌ **DON'T**:
- Use common passwords (`Password123!`, `Admin2024!`)
- Use personal information (birthdays, names)
- Share the password with anyone
- Write the password down

### Email Address Recommendations

- Use a dedicated admin email (e.g., `admin@mywebsite.com`)
- Ensure the email account is secure (2FA enabled)
- Use an email you have reliable access to
- Consider using a group email if managing with a team

---

## What Gets Created

When this step completes, the system:

1. **Creates Identity User**
   - Email stored in ASP.NET Core Identity tables
   - Password hashed using PBKDF2 (secure)
   - User ID generated automatically

2. **Assigns Administrator Role**
   - User added to "Administrators" role
   - Full permissions granted automatically

3. **Sets Admin Email Config**
   - Email saved as `AdminEmail` in system settings
   - Used as default sender for system emails

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Email address is required"

**Solution**: Enter a valid email address in the format `user@domain.com`

### "Password does not meet requirements"

**Causes**:
- Too short (less than 8 characters)
- Missing uppercase letter
- Missing lowercase letter
- Missing number
- Missing special character

**Solution**: Create a password that meets all requirements listed above.

### "Passwords do not match"

**Solution**: Ensure the password and confirmation fields are identical (check for typos).

### "Email already exists"

**Cause**: An administrator account with this email was already created.

**Solutions**:
1. Use a different email address
2. Or, reset the database and start setup over
3. Or, complete setup and use the existing account

### "Failed to create administrator account"

**Common Causes**:
- Database connection issue
- Database permissions insufficient
- Identity tables not created

**Solution**:
- Check application logs for detailed error
- Verify database connection string is correct
- Ensure database user has create/write permissions

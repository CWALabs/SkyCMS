## Configuration Reference

### Verify Configuration

Check that all settings were applied correctly:

**Via Admin Panel**:
1. Log in as administrator
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Configuration**
3. Review all configured values

**Via Environment Variables**:
```powershell
# View current environment variables
Get-ChildItem Env: | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "Cosmos*" -or $_.Name -like "*Connection*" }
```

**Via Database**:
- Configuration stored in `Settings` or `Configuration` table/container
- Query directly if needed (advanced)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Setup Wizard Still Accessible After Restart

**Issue**: Navigating to `/___setup` still shows the wizard.

**Cause**: Setup lock not applied or environment variable override.

**Solution**:
1. Check database for `CosmosAllowSetup` setting (should be `false`)
2. Verify no environment variable sets `CosmosAllowSetup=true`
3. Restart application again
4. Clear browser cache

---

### Cannot Log In with Admin Credentials

**Issue**: Login fails with error or "Invalid credentials".

**Possible causes**:
- Incorrect username/password
- Password case-sensitive
- Cookie/session issues

**Solution**:
1. Verify username and password (check for typos)
2. Try password reset via email (if email configured)
3. Clear browser cookies
4. Check application logs for errors
5. If all else fails, reset password via database (advanced)

---

### Published Pages Not Appearing

**Issue**: Pages edited in CMS don't appear on public site.

**Possible causes**:
- Page not published (saved as draft)
- Publisher service not running
- CDN caching old content

**Solution**:
1. In editor, verify page status is "Published" (not "Draft")
2. Check that Publisher service is running
3. If CDN configured, purge cache
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for static pages to regenerate

---

### File Uploads Not Working

**Issue**: Cannot upload files via file manager.

**Possible causes**:
- Storage connection issue
- File type not allowed
- File size exceeds limit

**Solution**:
1. Verify storage connection in Settings
2. Check file extension is in **Allowed File Types** list (from Step 3)
3. Check file size is under limit (default: 10 MB)
4. Review application logs for errors

---

### Email Not Sending

**Issue**: Password reset or notification emails not delivered.

**Possible causes**:
- Email provider not configured
- Invalid credentials
- Sender email not verified
- Email in spam folder

**Solution**:
1. Verify email provider configured correctly in Settings
2. Re-test email connection via Settings → Email → Test
3. Check spam/junk folder
4. Verify sender email is verified (SendGrid/Azure)
5. Review application logs for email errors

---

## Re-Running Setup Wizard

If you need to re-configure via the setup wizard:

### ⚠️ **Warning**

Re-running setup can **overwrite existing configuration** and **reset settings**. Only do this if absolutely necessary.

### Steps to Re-Enable

1. **Set environment variable**:
   ```powershell
   $env:CosmosAllowSetup = "true"
   ```

2. **Or update database**:
   - Locate `CosmosAllowSetup` setting in database
   - Set value to `true`

3. **Restart application**

4. **Navigate to setup wizard**:
   ```
   https://your-website-url/___setup
   ```

5. **After completing setup**:
   - Remove `CosmosAllowSetup=true` from environment
   - Restart application
